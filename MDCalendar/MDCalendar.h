/**
 *  `MDCalendar` is a calendar-style date picker for iOS 7 (and above) that uses `UICollectionView`
 *  to layout a calendar in the popular "month view" format.
 *
 *  ## Implementation Notes
 *
 *  `MDCalendar` was developed with flexibility in mind and is consequently implemented as a
 *  subclass of `UIView`. This means that a calendar may be instantiated as a subview in an existing
 *  view hierarchy or pushed onto a navigation stack as the sole view of a `UIViewController`. 
 *  The latter behavior is demonstrated in the `MDCalendarDemo` project.
 *
 *  One of the philosophies used while designing `MDCalendar` was to minimize an explicit storage-based
 *  model. As a result, the vast majority of date and geometry math is calculated on-the-fly. Caching,
 *  particularly for the geometric calculations has been implemented, and `MDCalendar` has been tested
 *  with an `endDate` of `[NSDate distantFuture]`.
 *
 *  ## Usage Example
 *  
 *  Suppose a view controller called `EventDetailsViewController` wants to allow
 *  users to modify the date of the event using a nice calendar picker. Hmm... let's
 *  use `MDCalendar` for that! `EventDetailsViewController` is a subclass of
 *  `UITableViewController` and selecting one of the rows should push a calendar
 *  on-screen and allow users to modify the `eventDate` property of the `EventDetailsViewController`
 *
 *  The advised implementation of this is to create a sparse view controller to display an
 *  `MDCalendar` (see the demo project for an example of how to do that). This view controller,
 *  let's call it `MDEventCalendarViewController` (creative, I know), will be pushed onto the navigation
 *  stack.
 *
 *  @see MDCalendarDelegate class below for information on how to pass events back to the parent view controller.
 *

/**
 * A delegate that responds to calendar events.
 *
 * Note: if a calendar view is pushed onto the navigation stack as the sole view of
 * a sparse view controller, then it is advised to subclass `MDCalendarDelegate` and 
 * implement the subclassed delegate in your parent view controller. 
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Suppose a view controller called `EventDetailsViewController` wants to allow
 * users to modify the date of the event using a nice calendar picker. Hmm... let's 
 * use `MDCalendar` for that! `EventDetailsViewController` is a subclass of 
 * `UITableViewController` and selecting one of the rows should push a calendar
 * on-screen and allow users to modify the `eventDate` property of the `EventDetailsViewController`
 * 
 * The advised implementation of this is to create a sparse view controller to display an
 * `MDCalendar` (see the demo project for an example of how to do that). This view controller, 
 * let's call it `MDEventCalendarViewController` (creative, I know), will be pushed onto the navigation
 * stack and will need to communicate calendar events back to its parent view controller.
 * In order to do this elegantly, subclass `MDCalendarDelegate` in `MDEventCalendarViewController` and
 * expose this protocol, `MDEventCalendarDelegate`, in the view controller's header.
 * Now, the parent view controller, `EventDetailsViewController`, can set its delegate.
 *
 * `id<MDEventCalendarDelegate>delegate`
 *
 * This delegate will essentially pass messages from `MDCalendarDelegate` onto the parent view controller.
 * Advantages of subclassing `MDCalendarDelegate` is that if you were to re-use your sparse view controller
 * it could contain some logic of how to interperet `MDCalendarDelegate` events.
